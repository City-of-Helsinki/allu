# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file forces the docker-java library (used internally by Testcontainers)
# to use Docker Remote API version 1.44 instead of its default autodetected
# version.
#
# Docker Desktop versions 29.x and later expose a newer API (e.g., 1.50-1.52).
# Older docker-java versions bundled with Testcontainers 1.19.x do not fully
# support these newer API versions and may incorrectly fall back to very old
# API versions (e.g., 1.32). This mismatch causes runtime failures such as
#
#   - "Could not find a valid Docker environment"
#   - HTTP 400 Bad Request when querying the Docker daemon
#   - Testcontainers starting with NpipeSocketClientProviderStrategy and failing
#
# By pinning the API version to 1.44, the communication becomes compatible:
# - Docker Desktop supports API 1.44 via backward compatibility
# - docker-java avoids fallback to outdated APIs
# - Testcontainers can successfully start containers during test execution
#
# This configuration is required for environments running Docker Desktop 29+
# until docker-java and Testcontainers fully support the newer API versions.
